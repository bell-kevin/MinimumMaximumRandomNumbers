# MinimumMaximumRandomNumbers
Create an application that asks the user for a minimum value and a maximum value, then calculates random numbers between those values. You will calculate one number with the Math.random() method, and another number with the Random class.  Acquire the user’s input as a string, then use wrapper classes to convert the string to numeric value. Make sure the input for the max value is greater than the min value; if it is not, keep asking the user for that max value until it is valid.  Once the min and max values are input, create one random number using the Math.random() method described in the article “Random Numbers” to create a number between the min and max values. Then create a second number using the Random class, also described in that article. Print out both random numbers – you don’t have to use “printf” to format this output. Note in the sample session how to print the output -- you must echo the min and max values in the first statement.
