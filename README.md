# MinimumMaximumRandomNumbers
Create an application that asks the user for a minimum value and a maximum value, then calculates random numbers between those values. You will calculate one number with the Math.random() method, and another number with the Random class.  Acquire the user’s input as a string, then use wrapper classes to convert the string to numeric value. Make sure the input for the max value is greater than the min value; if it is not, keep asking the user for that max value until it is valid.  Once the min and max values are input, create one random number using the Math.random() method described in the article “Random Numbers” to create a number between the min and max values. Then create a second number using the Random class, also described in that article. Print out both random numbers – you don’t have to use “printf” to format this output. Note in the sample session how to print the output -- you must echo the min and max values in the first statement.


== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project.  We have an
[open {bug ticket, mailing list thread, etc.} ](INSERT_LINK) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
[check this resource](INSERT_LINK) for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
